This PCBA was designed using Altium Designer V25 (https://www.altium.com/), a closed-source PCB design software. For outside developers we recommend KiCad (https://www.kicad.org/), which is an open-source PCB design software. A script for converting Altium files into KiCad files can be found here (use at your own risk): [http://www2.futureware.at/KiCad/
